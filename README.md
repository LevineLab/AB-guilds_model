# AB-guilds_model

The AB method is a statistical dimension reduction approach for identifying microbial metabolic guilds from binary data sets of functions (e.g., gene annotations). This method can be applied to any type of binary data and determines the underlying groups of features that are driving the distribution of feature presence/absence in the overall data set.

#Current Release

Currently, we provide an R markdown file and all of the requisite data objects necessary to reproduce the major figures and tables from the associated publication. A full release of the code will be made available to download and implement independently soon, followed by a complete R package. However, if you are interested in applying this method to your data prior to that release, please feel free to reach out to github user ryanreyn directly to assist you.
